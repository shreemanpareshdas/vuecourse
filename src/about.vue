     <h2>About QUICK learn</h2>
                        <p>The Department of Computer Science was established in Utkal University, Bhubaneswar in the year 1990,
 with the objective of imparting quality education in the field of Computer Science. With rapidly evolving technology and
 the continuous need for innovation the department has always produced quality professionals, holding important positions in Information Technology industry in India and abroad.
 The Department started the three year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) programme in the year 1990.
 The 5 years Integrated MCA (IMCA) and two year M. Sc. (Computer Science) was introduced as self finance mode in the year 1999, and 2001 respectively.
 The Master in Computer Engineering course was introduced in the year 2005 with full assistance from Minstry of IT (MIT),
 Government of India.Besides these the Department has strong research interests in diverse branches of Computer Science and offers a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Programme aimed at producing quality researchers.
